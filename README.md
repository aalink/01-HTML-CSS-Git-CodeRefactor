# 01-HTML-CSS-Git-CodeRefactor

This is the first assignment for the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp.
The goal is to demonstrate the ability of refactoring code while maintaining the look of the website.

```
Semantic HTML is a very important aspect of this assignment for a few reasons:
```
> 1) Semantic corrections will make the page more accessible to end users with disabilities.

> 2) Search engines are more likely to understand the content of your website. SEO, also known as search engine optimization, is significantly improved when a semantic approach is taken. As a result, end users are more likely to be directed to your website if they are searching for a product or service you offer.

> 3) Maintaining the code is much easier because semantic elements are more readable and understandable.  The original code in this assignment used a significant amount of `<div>` elements.  Replacing them with elements such as `<article>` and `<aside>` are a couple of examples that make the code more organized and easier to understand.


```
The DRY Principle: "Don't repeat yourself"
```

> Redundant code was another issue that needed to be addressed in this assignment. The CSS file presented several violations of the DRY principle.  Over 50 lines of class code was removed.  Then the code that remained from those classes were renamed to something more general, which in turn was more reusable in the HTML file.
